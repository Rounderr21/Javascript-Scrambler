# Project Description
This Project is designed to make and produce a randomly generated password depending on user input of quantity of characters and types of characters they want included in the password. Challenges that I faced are trying to create functions to apply correct course of action if user input is not with the specified range of 8- 128 characters.

When you open the project you are presented with the generate password button. Upon clicking this button you will prompted to input a value of how long you would like to make your password. Once you choose a number that is within the allowed range, it will ask you what type of characters you would like in this password. If you click ok it will add those character, and if you click cancel it will not add those characters. Once you have specicifed what criteria you want in your password a random password will appear before you. Evertime you hit the generate password it will ask the same criteria once more.

# HTML File
Started with a starter code. Found that the HTML file had many non-semantic tags. Used semantic HTML tags to ensure a well-structed document. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# CSS File
Started with a starter code. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read, and to inform them of where the elements are being used.

# Javascript File
Started with a starter code. Made Fuctions generatePassword and showPrompt. Used if statements to evaluate what the user inputed. if true it will allow those characters into the variable charset and from there generate a random code. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# Github
Pushed out commits of the HTML, CSS, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.
